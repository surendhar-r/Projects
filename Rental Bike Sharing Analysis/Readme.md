# Rental Bike Sharing Analysis

Bike-sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals, characterized by a fully automated process from start to finish. With these systems, users can effortlessly rent a bike from a specific starting point and return it at any other location. Currently, there is significant interest in these systems, driven by their crucial role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health concerns. Furthermore, the data generated by these systems can be utilized to analyze usage patterns and trends.

## Dataset Overiew

This dataset was sourced from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5W894.

The core dataset is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA. 
The data has been aggregated on a daily basis, and the corresponding weather and seasonal information were extracted and added. Weather information was sourced from http://www.freemeteo.com.

## Empirical Analysis

The dataset was partitioned into two sets, 75% for training and 25% for testing. The data is analyzed using a simple linear regression model with one key predictor variable.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a significant 65% increase in bike rentals from 2011 to 2012, suggesting growing popularity in bike-sharing services. The data further indicates that demand for bikes is strongly influenced by weather conditions, with rentals increasing as temperatures rise and on days with clearer skies. A simple linear regression model confirms that temperature is a key predictor of bike rentals, showing a positive correlation between higher temperatures and the number of bikes rented. This finding emphasizes the role of favorable weather in driving bike rental demand.
